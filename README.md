Requirements:
1. python3 virtual environment
2. flask
3. google colab


Iris-species prediction provides two functionalities namely
1. view dataset:
      After clicking on view dataset, one can view entire dataset in tabular format. This is the dataset using which models are trained.
      
3. Predict species:
      User Interface of Iris-species prediction provides horizontal range control bar to set values to sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. A dropdown menu is provided to select the trained model using which species is to be prdicted. Iris-species prediction repository contains two trained models named SVM-model and KNN-model. These models are trained using the python script 'iris-species-training.ipynb'. All the details of training process are mentioned in the file. After clicking on predict button, species will be shown with the image.
